    <h2>Spaghetti</h2>

    <p>Spaghetti is one of the most simple recipes for a new cook. The recipe can be broken into two parts:</p>
    
    <p><h3>Part 1: The Pasta</h3></p>
    <p>Boil a pot of water and place the pasta in the pot, fully submerging them. Once the noodles are the desired firmness, remove from heat, and drain the water using a colander. Then place the noodles back in the now dry pot.</p>
    
    <p><h3>Part 2: The Sauce</h3></p>
    <p>In a medium sized skillet, brown a pound of ground turkey or hamburger. Once browned, drain any excess grease in the pan if you're health-concious. Next, pour in a bottle of spaghetti sauce. I recommend Prego Italian sausage and garlic flavor. Heat the skillet to desired sauce temperature, then serve over your cooked pasta. <em>Enjoy!</em></p>
